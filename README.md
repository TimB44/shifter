# Shifter

A command-line tool for encrypting files using the ChaCha20 encryption algorithm and HMAC-SHA256.

In this project, I aim to implement several cryptographic primitives from scratch without relying on external libraries. The `Rand` crate is used for random number generation.  
The implemented algorithms include:  
- SHA-256  
- ChaCha20  
- HMAC  
- PBKDF2  

Since these algorithms are implemented manually, they are likely slower than hardware-accelerated versions provided by libraries.

## Current Status

Work in progress.
